# frozen-lake-q-learning
An exploration of the possibilities and a simpler recreation of the gym environment "Frozen Lake". Found publicly at this [link](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/).

## Purpose
The purpose was to recreate a simpler version of the Gym environment Frozen Lake. I wanted it to still be usable in a Neural Network and I wanted it to have some kind of rendering of the environment.

Feel free to use the very simple environment if you would like. It has a few kinks, as pointed out in comments, most notably that a path to victory is not guaranteed. It could be argued that in real life that is sometimes the case. ;)

# Footnote
This served as my quick getting back into Machine Learning project. It has a lot of outstanding issues that I do not know if I will get back to.
